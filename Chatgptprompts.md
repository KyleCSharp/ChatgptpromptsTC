what is html and css

ChatGPT
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are fundamental technologies used to create and design web pages.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

Purpose: HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of a web page. It defines the elements and tags that make up the various parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.
Syntax: HTML uses a set of predefined tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (< >), to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are often used in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag, to surround the content.
Example:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
  </body>
</html>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):

Purpose: CSS is a style sheet language that is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows web developers to define the visual style of elements on a web page, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
Syntax: CSS uses selectors to target HTML elements and declarations to define the styles. Declarations consist of a property (e.g., color, font-size) and a value (e.g., blue, 16px). CSS can be applied inline (within HTML tags), internally (within a <style> tag in the HTML head), or externally (in a separate CSS file).
Example:

css
Copy code
/* External CSS file (styles.css) */
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
}

p {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

/* Internal CSS in HTML head */
<style>
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: #0066cc;
  }
</style>
By combining HTML and CSS, web developers can create visually appealing and well-structured web pages. HTML defines the content and structure, while CSS enhances the presentation and styling of that content.
